How to set up the server side of jukeboxclient...

First of all, you obviously need a php enabled web server to host the files ;)
This guide assumes you are familiar with editing php files and making files publicly available on your server.

The server folder in the download contains a jukeboxserver.php.example file and and mp3 folder to hold the albums.

The jukeboxserver.php.example file in the download should be renamed to jukeboxserver.php and edited to set up any users who are authorised to run the script.
If there was no authorisation then the script could be copied and used by many users, resulting in heavy bandwidth usage on your server.

Authorisation uses two keys, THIS_USERS_SERVERKEY_UUID and THIS_USERS_OWNER_UUID which are checked when the script contacts the server.

THIS_USERS_OWNER_UUID is a unique key that you assign to the user you give your script to.
It can be any unique string you choose, but I prefer to generate a UUID for each user (there are many websites that can do this for you, I usually use http://www.famkruithof.net/uuid/uuidgen)
This string will be embedded in a Notecard you create and give to the user along with the script (more about that later).

THIS_USERS_OWNER_UUID alone will not stop the user copying the script and giving it (along with the Notecard) to other users so we also check THIS_USERS_OWNER_UUID
This is the In-World UUID of the user authorised to use the script and is part of the headers sent to the server by the In-World platform (e.g. Opensim)


The format for each user is:

//User Name 
$users[n] = array('serverkey' => 'THIS_USERS_SERVERKEY_UUID' , 'ownerkey' => THIS_USERS_OWNER_UUID');

The first line is a comment for your info only, you will probably want to put the user's In-World name avatar name in here but you can use anything you want

$users[n] - as we are setting up an array, your first user will br $users[0], 2nd $users[1] etc

THIS_USERS_SERVERKEY_UUID and THIS_USERS_OWNER_UUID should be replaced as explained above.


This example shows what this section of the jukeboxserver.php file might look like using real values:

//Set up some valid keys
	
//Fannybaws Tunwarm
$users[0] = array('serverkey' => 'f6923fc3-1907-4d67-81e0-545cfe690249' , 'ownerkey' => '1fe7be3a-38d7-480d-b436-3b2131bc9299');

//Kappa FaeBrillyunt
$users[1] = array('serverkey' => '50137076-7802-40a0-bc9c-c37a0c3f2b36' , 'ownerkey' => 'efde9f29-e2cf-4953-85aa-db9a9fc3b567');

//Fannybaws FaeBrillyunt
$users[2] = array('serverkey' => '6a5ec4d1-94df-43bb-8527-048715b6bf59' , 'ownerkey' => '19079452-7bf8-43dc-82b1-b60179463415');
